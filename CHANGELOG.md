# Changelog

## 0.6.0 (2026-10-08)

### Speed

Cube sample, 8 threads, against 0.5.0 (`bench/benchmark.py`): `g 1` at 98k facets
75 -> 10 ms, at 1.6M 1.34 -> 0.40 s; a Newton step at 98k 0.49 -> 0.10 s, at 1.6M
25.5 -> 2.8 s. Against the original Evolver 2.70a see `docs/performance.md`
(Lagrange 6 Newton step at 24k facets: 22.9 s there, 1.42 s here).

- Newton steps: MUMPS factoring (instead of Evolver's own), with its analysis kept
  across steps; the matrix pattern kept across steps and filled in parallel; vertex
  normals in parallel; all volume and quantity constraint columns solved at once.
- Lagrange models: the facet setup as a packed, vectorized kernel; the area and
  volume element Hessians as BLAS matrix products; each element's terms projected
  and entered once.
- Gradient steps: parallel named quantities (facet, edge and vertex integrals);
  per-thread sums kept on separate cache lines; attribute selections kept until the
  surface changes.
- `u` and `V`: the swap tests and vertex-average search in parallel, identical
  results (393k facets: `u` 0.30 -> 0.022 s, `V` 0.60 -> 0.12 s).
- Builds prefer the system's OpenMP OpenBLAS and link it statically with private
  symbols (no clash with NumPy's OpenBLAS); wheels bundle OpenBLAS 0.3.34 (OpenMP).

### Threads

- Default thread count: physical cores; `pyse.set_threads()`, `pyse.threads_limit()`
  and `threads=` per call; `pyse.map` workers run single-threaded.
- Safe Ctrl-C with threads: aborts wait until the parallel region or MUMPS call ends.
- Results agree with Evolver's serial loops to round-off and are reproducible to
  round-off from run to run.

### Library

- `ev.body_surfaces(cap=True)`: closed per-body surfaces, openings capped on the
  constraint their rim lies on (points projected by Evolver); `BodySurface.cap_ids`
  and `cap_constraints`; `BodySurface.volume_mesh()` for tetrahedral meshes with
  Gmsh (physical groups for the surface, caps and body).
- Notebook display: HTML summaries of `Evolver`, `Mesh`, bodies and parameters
  (`jupyter` extra); faster live view; a warning before very large tessellations.
- `busy_timeout` / `EvolverBusyError`: optionally wait for a running call from
  another thread instead of failing at once.
- `pyse.map` fails fast with `WorkerStartError` when workers can't start.

### Breaking changes

- `Mesh` arrays renamed to `facets`, `facet_ids`, `facet_bodies`; unused low-level
  bindings (`edges`, `facets`, `element_nodes`) removed.

### Fixes

- Edges with a density in a soapfilm model with a metric crashed (stack overflow,
  also in the original Evolver); they now use the metric edge length.
- Switching `bezier_basis` in a Lagrange model gave wrong energies (stale cached
  basis tables).
- Double free after a failed Newton step; signed overflow in the sparse Hessian
  hash; `metis_factor` falling through to the MKL setup; METIS 5 API.
- The torus display mode no longer carries over to the next loaded datafile.

### Documentation and tooling

- Sphinx documentation (API reference, double-bubble tutorial, liquid-bridge and
  slit-droplet examples with mesh export), published to GitHub Pages by CI.
- Performance comparison with the original Evolver 2.70a.
- MIT license for pySE's own code; third-party license notices shipped in wheels.
- Sanitizer runs include an OpenMP build with Newton steps, `u` and `V`;
  `tools/valgrind.supp`.
